# SamPuzznic
Sam Coupé Puzznic clone, written in 100% z80 assembler

# Background
Started in around 1994, when I was a teenager, making some tiles and graphics.
I recently rediscovered the original floppy disks with that work, and decided to see
if I could implement the full game from scratch.
I've never really finished any z80 projects.  I have a lot of started-some-ideas-and-then-stopped,
mostly because I didn't have the requisite skills back then. This is the first 'recent' z80 thing
I've done.

# Status
Work-In-Progress.
Tiles graphics imported, lots of other graphics missing.
Most of the movement/falling logic is in place, not much else yet (in particular, no 'matching'
logic yet, and no sliders/elevators)
No level select, scoring, game-over, etc.

# To build
I use VSCode with pyz80 extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=simonowen.pyz80
Using the default settings, you can launch SimCoupe by opening first.z80 in VSCode and pressing Ctrl+F10
